### **Revised Explanation: Why Store the Script on the External Drive**

You’re absolutely right! If you’re reimaging the SD card, **storing the script on the external drive** (`/mnt/plex_media2/backups/`) is the correct approach. Here’s why:

---

### **1. Script Survival During Reimaging**
- **Problem**: If the script is stored on the SD card (e.g., `~/scripts/backup_all.sh`), it will be **wiped during reimaging**.  
- **Solution**: Store the script on your **external drive** (`/mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/`).  
  - The script survives reimaging and remains accessible for future use.  

---

### **2. How to Adjust the Setup**
#### **A. Store the Script on the External Drive**
1. **Create a scripts directory on the external drive**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts
   ```
2. **Save the script there**:  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/backup_all.sh
   ```
   Paste the script contents and save.  

3. **Make it executable**:  
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/backup_all.sh
   ```

#### **B. Post-Reimaging Usage**
After reimaging the SD card:  
1. **Remount the external drive**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/plex_media2  # Replace with your drive ID
   ```
2. **Run the script**:  
   ```bash
   /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/backup_all.sh
   ```

### **3. Why This Works**  
| Scenario | Outcome |  
|----------|---------|  
| **Script Location** | External drive (`/mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/`). |  
| **During Reimage** | Script remains intact on the external drive. |  
| **Post-Reimage** | Run the script directly from the external drive. |  

---

### **4. Updated Backup Directory Structure**  
Your external drive will now have:  
```  
/mnt/plex_media2/backups/  
├── docker/       # Docker configs  
├── samba/        # Samba configs  
├── system/       # System files  
└── scripts/      # Backup script(s)  
```

---

### **Critical Notes**  
1. **Permissions**: Ensure your user has execute permissions on the script:  
   ```bash
   sudo chown koalacodes:koalacodes /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/backup_all.sh
   ```
2. **Cron Jobs**: After reimaging, recreate cron jobs by pointing to the script on the external drive:  
   ```bash
   crontab -e  
   # Add this line:  
   0 3 * * * /mnt/plex_media2/backups/scripts/backup_all.sh
   ```

---

### **Summary**  
- **Store the script on the external drive** to ensure it survives reimaging.  
- **Run it directly from the external drive** post-reinstall.  
- **Update cron jobs** to reference the external drive path.  

This approach ensures your backup workflow is **resilient and reusable** across system reinstalls. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
